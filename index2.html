    <p1>Amie Arias, the original owner of Vegan Van is who started it all. <br> Through Amie, our lives were changed and by 2013, the demand for vegan food was in high. 
        <br>We then stepped in and joined Amie on the truck, learning to laugh a lot and our love of making vegan food. <br> When Amie left, we decided to take over.
        Through this, our passion of cooking began and never stopped.</p1><br>
    <p1>We are Colorado natives who have been vegan for over 5 years, with our involvement in the community since 2012, <br> where we started cooking a community dinner called Chomp. </p1><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Just because ownership of Vegan Van has changed, doesn’t mean that the values haven’t. </p1>
